# Additional description about the project and its features.

This is my first capstone project in the Microverse of Module 1 in which I built Artificial Intelligence Global Summit 2021 . This is my responsive desktop version and mobile version conference site. The objective was to build a website by sticking with some design criteria. For that I created first-capstone-repo and cloned into my local machine. For best practices I have implemented Linter,Github Flow and professional documentation as much as I can. For the reference, you can click here to look at the design that i sticked on.
